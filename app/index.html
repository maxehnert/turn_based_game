      <!-- <p>Create a Turn-Based Game

        First and foremost, please have fun with this. This encapsulates all of the things you have worked with so far and possibly some new things               you'll learn as you push yourself. Remember to break this down into small tasks and commit often.
        2 - 3 Different Types of Players (3 Good Guy Types)
        2 - 3 Different Types of Enemies (3 Bad Guy Types)
        Have the game be interactive. Meaning I click a button to invoke an attack.
        Each player/enemy instance will start with an amount of points (health, life, etc)
        When a bad guy attacks a good guy, the good guy's points go down
        When a good guy attacks a bad guy, the bad guy's points go down
        When the player/enemy hits 0, show something visually that they have been defeated and who the winner is
        Use underscore _.random() or a different method to make sure there is a different outcome each time the game is played
        This needs to be styled as much as possible. Feel free to use graphics, images or whatever, but make sure that it looks good.</p> -->
